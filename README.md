### This project was inspired by DIO's Workshop "Semana Front-end" presented by Diogo Mainardes(https://github.com/diogomainardes), Michele Ambrosio(https://github.com/micheleambrosio), RenanJP(https://github.com/RenanJPaula), and Pablo Henrique.
### The goal of this project was to built a web page based on Netflix's Stranger Things using HTML, CSS and Javascript(First day), add a Firebase instance and integrate it with the frot-end, this DB instance will receive subscriptions of the new members of the Hellfire Club(Dungeons & Dragons club) and return an id of the new member after writing their info as a key-pair value(JSON in this case).
### Javascript was used for builting the functions responsible for: playing music, switching the page theme and its music based on each theme is currently on, and everything related to the firebase configs and imports needed to run this project properly.
